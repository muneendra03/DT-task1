In maximizing outreach to innovating schools, I have a system combining thorough research with systematic data management. With a Google Sheet having three specific tabs—raw data, categorized "baskets," and a messaging tracker—we have systematic, consistent, personalized communication.

The school innovation focus teaching priority, and communication style are maintained for customization of messaging. The schools are then segmented into baskets based on commonalities like program type (e.g. STEM, entrepreneurship), location (urban/ rural), and intensity (full curriculum vs extracurricular). This segmentation allows us to get very surgical with our outreach, e.g. entrepreneurship themed schools get a message about the opportunity to operate a student owned business.

Messaging tracker tab is committed not to drop a school. Conditional formatting displays schools that have not seen outreach progress, and status fields with dropdowns for maintaining data integrity. A “Customization Notes” field can be used to enhance the degree of customization by focusing on points like collaboration or curriculum alignment.

Ultimately, we judge high-potential schools. This is on the basis of a school's mission and openness to scenario planning. Not only does this make it easier, but it also makes it much more likely that we will be able to develop a partnership with innovative schools.
