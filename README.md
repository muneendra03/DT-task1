Scenario 1: Increase in Registrations (City B)

When student enrollments in City B increased by 20%, the figure went up to 180 students from 150.  We revised the resource requirements proportionately, ranking facilitators and kits above everything else.  Since City B hosted the highest number of students, we assigned 4 facilitators and 5 kits to accommodate the increased workload. City B's share was increased by reassigning a kit from City C and advancing City C's workshop marginally to gain equitable coverage.  This was achieved without going over the available resource while still maintaining high quality workshops.  The impact was a marginal scheduling delay for City C, but successful handling of greater demand in City B.

Scenario 2: Venue Unavailability (City A)

Because one of the venues in City A was no longer available, we had to schedule workshops on additional days.  Two venues were previously available to accommodate parallel sessions; with only one venue, City A could accommodate only one session at a time.  For processing the 100 students, we arranged three sessions over three days so that all students could attend without congestion. Facilitators and kits were reserved in City A for a prolonged duration, delaying their release in City C.  The primary concern was maintaining the quality of sessions intact by a rescheduling of schedule rather than cutting down service, exhibiting flexibility in scheduling resources.

Scenario 3: Late Kit Shipment

Due to a shipping delay, we received only 3 kits in the first two days.  We had to prioritize by student number to maximize initial impact.  City B, having the most students, received two kits, and City A received one. City C, with the lowest number, was to start after the delayed kit arrived on Day 3.  This minimized disruption and enabled most students to be working early in the week.  The selection balanced urgency with fairness, making the most of limited resources while meeting all cities' needs.
